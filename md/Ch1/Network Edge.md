## The Network Edge
* Edge of the Network:
    Applications and End systems
* Access network:
  Network which physically connects end systems to the first router (*edge router*)

Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access:
* DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
  DSL is offered by the same company(telco), your local telephone company

  * The data are translated digital data to high-frequency tones to the CO, converted back to digital format by DSLAM (Digita Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer).

  * Data and telephone signals are transmited by the same wire simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies

  * DSL providers purposelly limit the residential rate
  1. Different rate, different prices
  2. Max rate would be limited due to some reasons
      * Distance
      * Gauge of the twisted-pair line
      * Degree of electrical interference
* Cable Internet Access
  Since both fiber and coaxial cables are involved, also referred as 'HFC (Hybrid fiber coax)'
  1. Fiber optics connect the cable head end to the neighborhood-level junctions, each could support 500-5000 homes
  2. Then use coaxial to reach individual house 
  3. Use Cable Modems
  4. CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System) plays the role similar with DSLAM at the head end of cable (CO of cabel television company)
  5. It **shares broadcast medium**, so if many users are reuqesting the web simultaneously, the stream would be very low
  6. For this reason, it also needs a distributed multiple access protocol to coordinate transimisson and avoid collisions
* FTTH (Fiber to the Home)
